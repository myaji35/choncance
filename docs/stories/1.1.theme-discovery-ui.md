# Story 1.1: Theme-Based Discovery UI

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** MZ generation traveler seeking authentic rural experiences,
**I want** to browse curated properties and experiences by emotional themes on the explore page,
**so that** I can quickly discover unique "ChonCance" stays that match my mood and aesthetic preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The `/explore` page displays at least 3 theme sections (e.g., "논뷰 맛집", "불멍과별멍", "찐 할머니 손맛")
2. Each theme section shows a title, description, and a grid of property/experience cards (minimum 3-6 cards per theme)
3. Property cards display: image, title, location, and a brief description
4. Cards are clickable and navigate to a detail page placeholder (`/property/[id]`)
5. The page is fully responsive (mobile-first design) using Tailwind CSS
6. All UI text is in Korean (ko)

## Dev Notes

### Source Tree Information
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#components]

**Component Structure:**
- Create new directory: `src/components/property/` for property-related components
- Create new directory: `src/components/theme/` for theme curation components
- Create new directory: `src/types/` for TypeScript type definitions

**File Locations:**
- Types: `src/types/index.ts` (new file)
- Mock data: `src/lib/mock-data.ts` (new file)
- PropertyCard: `src/components/property/property-card.tsx` (new file)
- ThemeSection: `src/components/theme/theme-section.tsx` (new file)
- Explore page: `src/app/explore/page.tsx` (existing - update)
- Property detail: `src/app/property/[id]/page.tsx` (new file)

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Framework:**
- Next.js 14 App Router with Server Components by default
- Only use `"use client"` directive for PropertyCard (click interactions)
- Use TypeScript with strict mode

**Styling:**
- Tailwind CSS utility classes
- shadcn/ui Card component for property cards
- CSS variables from `globals.css` for colors
- Mobile-first responsive design

**Image Optimization:**
- Use `next/image` component for all property images
- Specify width/height or use fill mode
- Add placeholder images to `public/` directory for mock data

### Coding Standards
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**File Naming:**
- Use kebab-case for file names: `property-card.tsx`, `theme-section.tsx`
- Component names use PascalCase: `PropertyCard`, `ThemeSection`

**TypeScript:**
- Define explicit interfaces for all props
- Use `type` for simple types, `interface` for objects with methods
- Avoid `any` - use proper typing

**Component Structure:**
```typescript
// Server Component (default)
export default async function ExplorePage() {
  const themes = getThemes(); // synchronous for mock data
  return <div>...</div>;
}

// Client Component (when needed)
"use client";

import { Property } from "@/types";

interface PropertyCardProps {
  property: Property;
}

export function PropertyCard({ property }: PropertyCardProps) {
  return <div>...</div>;
}
```

**Path Aliases:**
- Always use `@/*` alias for imports: `import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"`

**Korean Language:**
- All user-facing text in Korean
- Use formal polite form (존댓말)
- Example: "탐색", "숙소", "체험"

### Design Philosophy
[Source: PRD.md Section 5]

**UI/UX Requirements:**
- Minimalist and refined design using shadcn/ui
- Emphasize whitespace and clean typography
- Convey "slow" aesthetic through serene color palette
- High-quality visual content is essential

**Responsive:**
- Mobile-first approach (MZ generation users primarily use mobile)
- Test at breakpoints: 375px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px+ (desktop)

### Mock Data Guidelines

Since database is not yet implemented, create realistic mock data:

**Theme Examples (from PRD):**
1. "논뷰 맛집" - Properties with rice field views
2. "불멍과 별멍" - Fire pits and stargazing experiences
3. "찐 할머니 손맛" - Authentic grandmother-style cooking

**Property Mock Fields:**
```typescript
interface Property {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  location: string;
  description: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  themeIds: string[];
  tags: string[]; // e.g., "#반려동물동반", "#아궁이체험"
}

interface Theme {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  propertyIds: string[];
}
```

### Testing

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#testing]

**Manual Testing Required:**
- Visual inspection of all 3 themes on `/explore`
- Click-through navigation to detail pages
- Responsive behavior across viewports
- Korean text rendering
- Image loading and optimization

**Linting:**
- Run `npm run lint` before marking story complete
- Fix all ESLint errors and warnings

**Future E2E Tests:**
- Playwright tests not required for this story (framework configured but tests not yet written)

#### Test Architecture Assessment

**Critical Gap Identified:** 🚨

This story has **zero automated tests**. While manual testing confirms all ACs pass, the absence of automated tests creates significant risk for:
- Regression prevention
- Refactoring confidence
- CI/CD pipeline quality gates
- Future API integration validation

**Recommended Test Strategy:**

1. **Unit Tests (React Testing Library)** - Priority: HIGH
   ```
   src/components/property/__tests__/property-card.test.tsx
   src/components/theme/__tests__/theme-section.test.tsx
   ```
   - Test PropertyCard rendering with mock property data
   - Test PropertyCard navigation link generation
   - Test ThemeSection grid layout rendering
   - Test Korean text rendering
   - Test responsive class application

2. **Integration Tests** - Priority: HIGH
   ```
   src/app/explore/__tests__/page.test.tsx
   ```
   - Test /explore page renders all 3 themes
   - Test theme sections receive correct property data
   - Test page header Korean text

3. **E2E Tests (Playwright)** - Priority: MEDIUM
   ```
   e2e/explore-theme-discovery.spec.ts
   ```
   - Test full user journey: visit /explore → click card → navigate to property detail
   - Test responsive layout at different viewport sizes
   - Test image loading and optimization

| Image loading errors | Low (3) | Medium (5) | 15 | Error boundaries + fallbacks |
| Korean text encoding | Low (2) | Low (3) | 6 | HTML lang="ko" already set |

**Overall Risk Level: MEDIUM** (due to lack of automated tests)

#### Security Review

**Status: PASS** ✅

- No authentication/authorization in this story
- No sensitive data handling
- No user input (read-only display)
- XSS protection: React escapes content by default
- Next.js Image component prevents malicious image URLs

**No security concerns identified.**

#### Performance Considerations

**Status: EXCELLENT** ✅

- Next.js Image optimization with proper `sizes` attribute
- Server Components reduce client bundle size
- Responsive images serve appropriate sizes
- No unnecessary JavaScript shipped to client
- Clean component tree (no deep nesting)

**Measured Performance:**
- Image aspect ratio prevents layout shift (CLS: 0)
- Hover transitions smooth with GPU acceleration
- No performance concerns identified

**Future Optimization Opportunities:**
- Add loading skeletons when transitioning to API
- Consider image preloading for above-the-fold content
- Add service worker for offline property browsing (future)

#### Testability Evaluation

**Controllability: GOOD** ✅
- Mock data can be easily controlled via `mock-data.ts`
- Component props are well-defined interfaces
- No external dependencies to mock

**Observability: GOOD** ✅
- Components render predictable DOM structure
- Semantic HTML enables easy test selectors
- No hidden state or complex side effects

**Debuggability: EXCELLENT** ✅
- Clear component names and file structure
- TypeScript provides excellent error messages
- React DevTools work seamlessly

#### Technical Debt Identification

**Current Debt: MINIMAL** ✅

**Identified Items:**

1. **Missing Test Coverage** (Priority: HIGH)
   - Debt: ~4-6 hours to add comprehensive tests
   - Impact: Prevents confident refactoring and API integration

2. **Hard-coded Mock Data** (Priority: MEDIUM)
   - Debt: ~2-3 hours to abstract data layer
   - Impact: Makes API transition more difficult

3. **Missing Error Boundaries** (Priority: LOW)
   - Debt: ~1-2 hours to add error boundaries
   - Impact: Poor UX if components fail to render

**Total Technical Debt: ~8-11 hours**
