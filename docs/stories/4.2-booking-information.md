# Story 4.2: Booking Information Input

## Status

## Story
**As a** guest ready to book a property,
**I want** to enter guest count and special requests,
**so that** the host knows my needs and can prepare accordingly.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Minimum 1 adult required
3. Maximum guests limited by property capacity
4. Contact information pre-filled from user profile (editable)
5. Special requests text area (optional, max 500 characters)
6. Optional experiences checkboxes if property offers them
7. Form validation with Korean error messages
8. Data persists to booking object on submission
9. Responsive layout on all devices

## Tasks
- [ ] Create BookingInfoForm component
- [ ] Guest count inputs with increment/decrement buttons
- [ ] Fetch property.maxGuests and validate against it
- [ ] Pre-fill contact info from Clerk user data
- [ ] Special requests textarea with character counter

## Dev Notes
**Validation Schema:**
```typescript
const bookingInfoSchema = z.object({
  adults: z.number().min(1).max(10),
  children: z.number().min(0).max(5),
  phone: z.string().regex(/^010-\d{4}-\d{4}$/),
  requests: z.string().max(500).optional(),
